## What is Reinforcement Learning?
**Reinforcement learning (RL)** is a subfield of **machine learning (ML)** that addresses the problem of the automatic learning of optimal decisions over time. 

 RL is an approach that natively incorporates an extra dimension (which is usually time, but not necessarily) into learning equations.
